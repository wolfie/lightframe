		<h1>LightFrame Project Page</h1>
		<p>
			LightFrame currently lacks a proper webpage, and probably will
			continue to be without one for a while (due to development time
			constraints). This is why I set up this little page to give an
			overview of the different resources being used during the
			LightFrame development.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The sites are:
		</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://lightframe.org/">http://lightframe.org/</a></h2>
		<p>
			These pages. This will be changed once a proper 'community
			website' has been constructed. This includes a manual,
			installation files, and probably some kind of discussion forum.
		</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://blog.lightframe.org/">http://blog.lightframe.org/</a></h2>
		<p>
			Random thoughts. A place where I (and, for the moment, only I
			&ndash; Hopefully that'll change...) jot down my thoughts that
			might relate to LightFrame, the development thereof, or maybe of
			above.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The best source for status reports on LightFrame, definitely.
		</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://repo.lightframe.org/">http://repo.lightframe.org/</a></h2>
		<p>
			Hot cakes. This is how LightFrame's source looks like at any given
			moment. This is the official LightFrame source repository, and
			it's a free-for-all.
		</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://tickets.lightframe.org/">http://tickets.lightframe.org/</a></h2>
		<p>
			Todos. A mix of bug reports, upcoming features, "how about
			this?":es and the occasional unintelligible mumbling that, at the
			time, seemed very important to write down for the future me.
			Without this, LightFrame would've probably be ditched ages ago.
		</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://github.com/wolfie/lightframe-documentation/">Documentation</a></h2>
		<p>
			The user manual in its present state. This is what I'm working on
			currently, and one of the most important components for the
			community site. The manual is written in <a
			href="http://github.com/wolfie/php-markdown/tree/extra">slightly
			modified Markdown</a>, so don't be surprised if it doesn't render
			properly with a normal parser.
